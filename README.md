# Javascript Object Oriented Programming

## OOP Coding Pillers
1. Abstraction: Hide something for simplicity but that is very much important for funtionalities.

2. Encapsulation: Keep propertise & method private. That private method will not work outside the object.

3. Inheritence: Child class will take matching propertise and values from parent class. 

4. Polymorphism: This will behave many ways. a child class can overwite a method that inherited from parent class.

4. Declarative Programming
### Structure of OOP 
==> Clases -> Blue Print 
==> Objects 
==> Propertise 
==> methods
### Object Making ways in OOP
1. Function Constructor(es5)
